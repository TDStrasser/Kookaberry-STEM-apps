# Kookaberry PiicoDev Demonstration Apps
This repository contains pre-coded PiicoDev demonstration apps, written in MicroPython for the Kookaberry micro-computer.
To use an app, download it from one of the folders in the repository, and then either:
- save it in the *Kookaberry Scripts / KookaIDE* folder (or a sub-folder) on your desktop computer. Then use the **KookaIDE** or **KookaCode** programming tool to open it and click on the Run button to cause it to run on a USB-tethered Kookaberry.
- save it in the *app* folder on the Kookaberry's file storage system and use the Kookaberry's built-in **app menu** to select and run it.
