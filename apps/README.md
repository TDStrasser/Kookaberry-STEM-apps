# Kookaberry STEM Apps
This repository contains pre-coded STEM apps, written in MicroPython for the Kookaberry micro-computer.
To use an app, download it from one of the folders in the repository, and then either:
- save it in the *Kookaberry Scripts / KookaIDE* folder (or a sub-folder) on your desktop computer. Then use the **KookaIDE** programming tool to open it and click on the Run button to cause it to run on a USB-tethered Kookaberry.
- save it in the *app* folder on the Kookaberry's file storage system and use the Kookaberry's built-in **app menu** to select and run it.

This repository is organised into folders representing a STEM area of interest, such as music, maths, digital technology, environment etc.  

Each folder contains a further description of its contents. Please feel free to explore, download, run and experiment with your Kookaberry.
