# Kookaberry Graphing Apps
This is a repository of pre-coded graphing apps for use with the Kookaberry micro-computer.
These apps assist in visualising the data that has been collected and stored by other Kookaberry apps in CSV (Cooma Separated Variables) files.

This repository includes the following:
- **_GraphCSV** - Lists CSV files in the Kookaberry's root file folder, and then processes the chosen file to produce a chart on a web page that can be viewed using a web browser.
  - The CSV data is presumed to have categories in column 1, then numerical data.
  - The html file requires JavaScript libraries stored on the Kookaberry in the c3d3 folder. 
  - To obtain the app and the required JavaScript files, download the _GraphCSV.zip file and extract the contents into the Kookaberry.
