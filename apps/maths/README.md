# Kookaberry Mathematics Apps
This is a repository of MicroPython mathematics apps in MicroPython for use with the Kookaberry micro-computer.

Included in this repository are:
- **Chances** - An exercise in probability.  A circle is defined with 2 to 6 segments, each but the last segment with an adjustable angle.  
  - Once defined, a randomised spinner can be spun multiple times and the frequency of landing on each segment recorded.
  - A graph is shown of the frequency histogram contrasted with the theoretical probability distribution.
  - The results can be saved to the 'Chances.csv' file on the Kookaberry.
  - Complementary app for viewing the CSV file as a graph: **_GraphCSV**
- **Fractions101** - Displays proper fractions to compare their relative sizes. There are modes to add and subtract fractions and to see their decimal equivalents.
  - See the description here https://learn.auststem.com.au/app/fractions101/
- **Spira** - Demonstrates mathematical roulette graphs, such as are implemented by the Spirograph toy
  - Reference https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph
- **Triangles** - An informational and quiz app on the subject of triangles.  It provides graphical examples and then runs a short quiz using randomised samples with multiple choice answers. It covers:
  - Types of triangles - equilateral, isosceles, scalene
  - Angles - sum to 180, acute, right angle, obtuse triangles
  - Perimeter - sum of the sides
  - Area of triangle - half height x width
