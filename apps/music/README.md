This is a repository of pre-coded music-related apps for use with the Kookaberry micro-computer:
- Metronome - A simulated metronome for providing music tempo:
  - Port **P1** is attached to a digital capacitive sensor or switch.
  - Port **P2** is attached to a loudspeaker peripheral.  The metronome beat is a PWM signal.
