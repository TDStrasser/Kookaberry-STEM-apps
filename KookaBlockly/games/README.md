  - A series of timed loops manipulate the main parameters to animate the face.
  - Download and modify the script to change the face's behaviour and/or appearance.
- **Sprites** - Steer your vertically descending sprite to avoid or collide with a sprite running left to right.  Displays the collision count
  - Use the C and D buttons to to steer your sprite.
  - Click the A button to exit
- **Tilt_n_Draw** - Make a pixel-trail drawing on the display.
