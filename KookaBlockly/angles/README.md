# KookaBlockly Angles Apps
These pre-coded apps deal with the concept of angles:
- **Inclinometer** - Uses the Kookaberry's in-built accelerometer to display the angle at which the Kookaberry is tilted.
- **Lissajous** - Displays a Lissajous figure (as in the Australian ABC logo)
  - Use the C and D buttons to increase or decrease the harmonic multiples of the X and Y sine waves that form the figure

- **Spiro** - draws a flower-like pattern on the display mimicking the pattern produced by a Spirograph toy.
  - There are no adjustment controls - just let it draw.  
  - Or you can modify the parameters using the **KookaBlockly** programming tool.
  - You can find the background and theory here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph
